# MyConsole

This gem provides a simple console for Ruby applications. It is intended to be used in applications that do not have a console, such as a Rails application. The console is a simple REPL that allows the user to execute Ruby code in the context of the application.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add my_console

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install my_console

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
